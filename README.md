## Purpose

This project was my first endeavour into unit testing in a project, so making sure I was testing sufficiently and wisely was an important aim. Given the focus on unit testing, I had to make sure I kept the logic and DOM manipulation as separate as possible, which I managed to uphold well. Alongside this, I focused on planning this project more thoroughly than those I had done before, given it's increase in complexity.
