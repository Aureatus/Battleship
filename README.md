# Battleship

## [Live Link](https://aureatus.github.io/Battleship/)


## Purpose
This project was my first usage of unit testing in a project, so i've learnt a lot from it in that regard, but i've also grown in terms of my planning abilites, as I planned this project out a lot more than previous ones. On top of that, a lot of the algorithms used in Battleship are far more complex and intertwining than anything previously written by me, so my logical thinking has grown.

## How to run
```
- git clone https://github.com/ZanyAlex/Battleship.git
- npm install
- npm audit fix
- npm run webpack
- Open dist/index.html
```
